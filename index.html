        <h3>Founder and Head</h3>
        <p>Summer of Side Projects - <a href="https://125summer.tech">125summer.tech</a></p>
        <p>Summer 2021</p>
        <p>
            Created a summer series of workshops and guided projects with practical topics like chatbots or web browser extensions. I handled the organization, managed the forum, gave individualized project feedback, and held 5 different workshops (Chatbots, Web Scraping, Fancy Command Line Interfaces, Browser Extensions, and React). This led to dozens of side projects created by students over the summer.
